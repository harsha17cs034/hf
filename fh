K Nagarkoti to Prithvi Shaw, out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Nagarkoti has his man. He has gone for quite a few but this should give him some relief. [Pounded it back of a length and Shaw backed away to hack it into the leg-side, but only manages a toe-end towards long-on, Gill runs and settles nicely under it. A fine knock comes to an end. Can KKR apply brakes now? b]Prithvi Shaw c Shubman Gill b K Nagarkoti 66(41) [4s-4 6s-4][/b]
